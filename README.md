# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of cancer using logistic regression. Logistic regression is a popular machine learning algorithm that 
is well-suited for binary classification problems, such as predicting whether a patient has cancer or not.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.6 or above

NumPy


Pandas


Scikit-learn


Matplotlib


Jupyter Notebook (optional)


You can install the required packages by running the following command:



Clone the repository or download the source code.

Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed.

Open the Jupyter Notebook file in Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment.

Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the logistic regression model, and make predictions.

Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different preprocessing techniques or machine learning algorithms to improve the prediction accuracy.
